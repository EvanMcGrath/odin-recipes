HTML project for TOP 

This project should be pretty easy for me as I have been 
practicing HTML and CSS a lot over the past month and a half.
This project is for people very new to HTML so I shouldn't 
find it too challenging. Nevertheless I'm going to give it 
my full attention and effort and do my best to learn what I
can from it. :)
